Register No: 212223230170
## Aim

  The aim of the QR-CampusAR project is to design and develop an Augmented Reality based indoor navigation system that helps students, faculty, and visitors easily locate destinations inside a college campus using QR codes and real-time AR guidance.
## Algorithm / Procedure

* Launch the QR-CampusAR mobile application.

* Activate the camera module to scan the QR code placed at the current campus location.

* Decode the QR code to identify the user’s current position.

* Display a list of available destinations (classrooms, labs, offices, etc.).

* Allow the user to select a destination.

* Retrieve the navigation path corresponding to the source and destination.

* Render Augmented Reality arrows and markers on the live camera view using ARCore.

* Continuously update navigation directions as the user moves.

* Notify the user when the destination is reached.

* End the navigation process.
